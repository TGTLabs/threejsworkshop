# threejsworkshop

# 1. Getting Started
## 1. Download a text editor or an [IDE (Integrated development environment)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) that is well supported for a specific or a range of programming languages you'd like to use.
Here are couple to get you started for Javascript:
1. [GitHub Atom](https://atom.io/): Most of the things you need out-of-the-box with a graphical interface for [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) version control, we will go with this one during our tutorial as the name is just cool!
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Microsoft's lightweight version of their awesome Visual Studio, has their proprietary IntelliSense to give you recommendations on the fly, see you don't need to remember all the syntax to be able to code!
3. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/): Android of the text editor world! Everything is customizable to your need with thousands of plugins, but just a text editor out-of-the-box.

## 2. Clone this repository and get ready to code!
>We like to use fancy words so people don't know what we are talking about.

[Boilerplate code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code) is just some code snippets that contain reusable but important code so we don't need to write the same thing agin when we start another project. For example, the goal for this workshop is not for you to understand how to write a HTML5 webpage from scratch nor how to properly initialize Three.js. So all those code will be provided to you so we can finish the workshop in one year.

1. Simply just download the zip [here] (https://github.com/TGTLabs/threejsworkshop/archive/master.zip), and unzip it to any place you like. Don't worry, it does not contain any virus nor ransomware as far as I know.
Or use the fancy `git clone git@github.com:TGTLabs/threejsworkshop.git` if you like to see texts flowing on your Terminal like a hacker in the movie. However, make sure you have `git` installed and credentials all set up for your GitHub. Vote for another workshop or offer me a beer if you are interested in how we engineers mess up others' code with some simple commands and end up in a fist fight.

2. Replace `/assets/spaceshuttle/textures/Material_197_baseColor.jpg` with your own.

3. Finally open `index.html` in the IDE you chose to use.

## 3. Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

It is surprising that how secure our web browsers are versus how many computers still get infected with virus and ransomware, but the truth is that we need to set up a web server to host our assets so the browser are happy with us loading some random 3d model file and some random images as the textures.

1. Make sure you have `python` installed. If you uses a Mac, you are covered.
2. Open `Terminal` and `cd The_Folder_You_Unzipped_The_Repository_To`
3. Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
4. Open your browser (don't mention Internet Explorer, it is not supported), type `localhost:8000` and Voila!
